/**
 * Each Media Type Object provides schema and examples for the media type identified by its key.
 * 
 * ### Media Type Examples
 * 
 * - Example with JSON
 * 
```json
{
  "application/json": {
    "schema": {
         "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
    },
    "examples": {
      "cat" : {
        "summary": "An example of a cat",
        "value": 
          {
            "name": "Fluffy",
            "petType": "Cat",
            "color": "White",
            "gender": "male",
            "breed": "Persian"
          }
      },
      "dog": {
        "summary": "An example of a dog with a cat's name",
        "value" :  { 
          "name": "Puma",
          "petType": "Dog",
          "color": "Black",
          "gender": "Female",
          "breed": "Mixed"
        },
      "frog": {
          "$ref": "#/components/examples/frog-example"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
 * 
 * - Example with YAML
 * 
```yaml
application/json: 
  schema:
    $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pet"
  examples:
    cat:
      summary: An example of a cat
      value:
        name: Fluffy
        petType: Cat
        color: White
        gender: male
        breed: Persian
    dog:
      summary: An example of a dog with a cat's name
      value:
        name: Puma
        petType: Dog
        color: Black
        gender: Female
        breed: Mixed
    frog:
      $ref: "#/components/examples/frog-example"
```

 * ### Considerations for File Uploads
 * 
 * In contrast with the 2.0 specification, `file` input/output content in OpenAPI is described with
 * the same semantics as any other schema type.
 * 
 * In contrast with the 3.0 specification, the `format` keyword has no effect on the
 * content-encoding of the schema. JSON Schema offers a `contentEncoding` keyword, which may be
 * used to specify the `Content-Encoding` for the schema. The `contentEncoding` keyword supports
 * all encodings defined in [RFC4648][2], including "base64" and "base64url", as well as
 * "quoted-printable" from [RFC2045][3]. The encoding specified by the `contentEncoding` keyword is
 * independent of an encoding specified by the `Content-Type` header in the request or response or
 * metadata of a multipart body -- when both are present, the encoding specified in the
 * `contentEncoding` is applied first and then the encoding specified in the `Content-Type` header.
 * 
 * JSON Schema also offers a `contentMediaType` keyword. However, when the media type is already
 * specified by the Media Type Object's key, or by the `contentType` field of an
 * [Encoding Object][4], the `contentMediaType` keyword SHALL be ignored if present.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * Content transferred in binary (octet-stream) MAY omit `schema`:
 * 
```yaml
# a PNG image as a binary file:
content:
    image/png: {}
```
 * 
 * 
```yaml
# an arbitrary binary file:
content:
    application/octet-stream: {}
```
 * 
 * Binary content transferred with base64 encoding:
 * 
```yaml
content:
    image/png:
        schema:
            type: string
            contentMediaType: image/png
            contentEncoding: base64
```
 * 
 * Note that the `Content-Type` remains `image/png`, describing the semantics of the payload. The
 * JSON Schema `type` and `contentEncoding` fields explain that the payload is transferred as text.
 * The JSON Schema `contentMediaType` is technically redundant, but can be used by JSON Schema
 * tools that may not be aware of the OpenAPI context.
 * 
 * These examples apply to either input payloads of file uploads or response payloads.
 * 
 * A `requestBody` for submitting a file in a `POST` operation may look like the following example:
 * 
```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    application/octet-stream: {}
```
 * 
 * In addition, specific media types MAY be specified:
 * 
```yaml
# multiple, specific media types may be specified:
requestBody:
  content:
    # a binary file of type png or jpeg
    image/jpeg: {}
    image/png: {}
```
 * 
 * To upload multiple files, a `multipart` media type MUST be used:
 * 
```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        properties:
          # The property name 'file' will be used for all files.
          file:
            type: array
            items: {}
```
 * 
 * As seen in the section on `multipart/form-data` below, the empty schema for `items` indicates
 * a media type of `application/octet-stream`.
 * 
 * ### Support for x-www-form-urlencoded Request Bodies
 * 
 * To submit content using form url encoding via [RFC1866][5], the following
 * definition may be used:
 * 
```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          id:
            type: string
            format: uuid
          address:
            # complex types are stringified to support RFC 1866
            type: object
            properties: {}
```
 * 
 * In this example, the contents in the `requestBody` MUST be stringified per [RFC1866][5] when
 * passed to the server. In addition, the `address` field complex object will be stringified.
 * 
 * When passing complex objects in the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type, the
 * default serialization strategy of such properties is described in the [`Encoding Object`][4]'s
 * [`style`][6] property as `form`.
 * 
 * ### Special Considerations for `multipart` Content
 * 
 * It is common to use `multipart/form-data` as a `Content-Type` when transferring request bodies
 * to operations.  In contrast to 2.0, a `schema` is REQUIRED to define the input parameters to
 * the operation when using `multipart` content.  This supports complex structures as well as
 * supporting mechanisms for multiple file uploads.
 * 
 * In a `multipart/form-data` request body, each schema property, or each element of a schema
 * array property, takes a section in the payload with an internal header as defined by
 * [RFC7578][7]. The serialization strategy for each property of a `multipart/form-data` request
 * body can be specified in an associated [`Encoding Object`][4].
 * 
 * When passing in `multipart` types, boundaries MAY be used to separate sections of the content
 * being transferred â€“ thus, the following default `Content-Type`s are defined for `multipart`:
 * 
 * - If the property is a primitive, or an array of primitive values, the default Content-Type is
 * `text/plain`
 * - If the property is complex, or an array of complex values, the default Content-Type is
 * `application/json`
 * - If the property is a `type: string` with a `contentEncoding`, the default Content-Type is
 * `application/octet-stream`
 * 
 * Per the JSON Schema specification, `contentMediaType` without `contentEncoding` present is
 * treated as if `contentEncoding: identity` were present.  While useful for embedding text
 * documents such as `text/html` into JSON strings, it is not useful for a `multipart/form-data`
 * part, as it just causes the document to be treated as `text/plain` instead of its actual media
 * type.  Use the Encoding Object without `contentMediaType` if no `contentEncoding` is required.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          id:
            type: string
            format: uuid
          address:
            # default Content-Type for objects is `application/json`
            type: object
            properties: {}
          profileImage:
            # Content-Type for application-level encoded resource is `text/plain`
            type: string
            contentMediaType: image/png
            contentEncoding: base64
          children:
            # default Content-Type for arrays is based on the _inner_ type (`text/plain` here)
            type: array
            items:
              type: string
          addresses:
            # default Content-Type for arrays is based on the _inner_ type (object shown, so `application/json` in this example)
            type: array
            items:
              type: object
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Address'
```

An `encoding` attribute is introduced to give you control over the serialization of parts of `multipart` request bodies.  This attribute is _only_ applicable to `multipart` and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` request bodies.
