/**
 * A simple object to allow referencing other components in the OpenAPI document, internally and
 * externally.
 * 
 * The `$ref` string value contains a URI [RFC3986][2], which identifies the location of the value
 * being referenced.
 * 
 * See the rules for resolving [Relative References][3].
 * 
 * This object cannot be extended with additional properties and any properties added SHALL be
 * ignored.
 * 
 * Note that this restriction on additional properties is a difference between Reference Objects
 * and [`Schema Objects`][1] that contain a `$ref` keyword.
 * 
 * ### Reference Object Example
 * 
```json
{
	"$ref": "#/components/schemas/Pet"
}
```
 * 
 * 
```yaml
$ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
```
 * 
 * ### Relative Schema Document Example
 * 
```json
{
  "$ref": "Pet.json"
}
```
 * 
 * 
```yaml
$ref: Pet.yaml
```
 * 
 * ### Relative Documents With Embedded Schema Example
 * 
```json
{
  "$ref": "definitions.json#/Pet"
}
```
 * 
 * 
```yaml
$ref: definitions.yaml#/Pet
```
